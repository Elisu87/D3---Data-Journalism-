Created a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare.
Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. Code for this graphic is in the app.js file of the homework directory which  pulled the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. The scatter plot ultimately appears like the image below.


- Included are the state abbreviations in the circles.


- Created and situated r axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

The data set included with this assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml . The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
